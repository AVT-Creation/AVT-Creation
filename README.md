ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AVT-Creation, on this account i'll publish many codes i've built in various languages, for training or just to show off

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding, learning how to make all sorts of things from scratches

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning lots of different subjects as a student in engeneering class in second year (four to go)

ðŸ“« How to reach me ? no way ... for now.

âš¡ Fun fact: there is no fun ... just coding.
